                        During my time at Les Creatives STHLM, working on the
                        Wewoosh platform, I contributed to the front-end
                        development and UI design of the application. My work
                        focused on creating a smooth, high-performance user
                        experience, where speed and responsive design were key
                        priorities. I collaborated closely with the product and
                        design teams to translate complex user requirements into
                        an intuitive, visually appealing interface, optimizing
                        the platform for seamless performance across devices.

                    <p class="text-left mt-2">
                        My responsibilities included designing reusable UI
                        components—such as custom typography styles, color
                        palettes, and section templates—tailored to ensure
                        visual consistency and streamline the user experience. I
                        leveraged best practices in responsive design, ensuring
                        that all UI elements were optimized for both desktop and
                        mobile users. Additionally, I implemented user feedback
                        systems that facilitated iterative design improvements,
                        enhancing both the aesthetics and usability of the
                        platform.
